## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 

A modern and responsive website. The backbone is formed by HTML, providing a structured layout for seamless navigation. CSS enhances aesthetics, ensuring a visually pleasing design. JavaScript adds interactivity, making the site dynamic and engaging. Bootstrap expedites development with pre-built components and a responsive grid system, ensuring a consistent look across devices. This tech synergy delivers a user-friendly platform for dog owners, featuring interactive services and comprehensive information. Dog Kennels Hub's tech stack harmoniously blends these elements, resulting in a visually appealing, functionally rich, and accessible canine care destination.


## Optimizations
I  optimized the sites loading time as it took a while to load. I achived this my compressing each image which resulted in most picture taking 55% less space. By having the images filling less the websites loading time was hugly improved. 



## Lessons Learned:
Through this project, I gained valuable insights into building a user-centric website. I deepened my proficiency in HTML for structured content, CSS for aesthetic presentation, and JavaScript for dynamic interactivity. Implementing Bootstrap expedited development --> bootstrap is your friend!. The experience enriched my understanding of creating a cohesive tech stack, harmonizing various elements to deliver a modern, responsive, and engaging platform for users. 

I used neovim as my IDE for this project which is so smooth to use and feels great getting more proficient in. 

Also used the developer tool for this project which speeded up the project as I was able to see what was happening and make quick chages first via writing it in the DOM first and the make the changes afterwards.
